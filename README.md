OOP Mini Projects

Welcome to my OOP Mini Projects repository! 🚀

This repository is a collection of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) mini projects that I am building as part of my project-based learning journey. Each project focuses on implementing OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction in a practical way.

📌 About This Repository

This repo contains small but meaningful OOP-based projects.

Each project follows best practices in OOP design and implementation.

The projects are built using C++.

The goal is to learn by building and improve OOP skills through hands-on experience.


🛠 Projects Included

(More projects will be added as I progress!)

🏗 Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++


📌 Why Project-Based Learning?

Helps in reinforcing OOP concepts with real-world examples.

Improves problem-solving and coding skills.

Encourages learning by doing instead of just theory.

Prepares for real-world software development.
